hello guys in this short readme i'm going to show you how to use this spellchecker,
First be sure to have the following packages:

> _termcolor_
>_pyspellchecker_
>
if you don't, do not worry, just type in your terminal:
```
$ pip install termcolor
$ pip install pyspellchecker
```
Then write the following in your terminal:
![zsh](https://github.com/juju-e/spell_checker/blob/master/img/step1.png)
You will see this window prompting you to write the words to be spellchecked:
![zsh](https://github.com/juju-e/spell_checker/blob/master/img/step2.png)
Then you will enter the words to be corrected:
![zsh](https://github.com/juju-e/spell_checker/blob/master/img/step3.png)
You should see the program showing you text like this:
![zsh](https://github.com/juju-e/spell_checker/blob/master/img/step3.png)
The text in green shows the best spelling,
It is then  followed by blue text which represents a set containing the other possible candidates,
At the end of the text you will see something like this:
![zsh](https://github.com/juju-e/spell_checker/blob/master/img/step5.png)

the white text at the end represents the entire corrected input (with the best spelling)
